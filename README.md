# Automated Flowchart Generator
## Project Overview
Welcome to my Automated Flowchart Generator project! This Python application automates the creation of flowcharts from structured data provided in CSV files. Utilizing the powerful Graphviz library, this project aims to simplify the visualization of processes and decision trees, making it a handy tool for data scientists, analysts, and anyone interested in structured visual representations.

## Features
Read Data from CSV: Loads data directly from CSV files to ensure that the input format is easy to prepare and widely accessible.
Dynamic Flowchart Creation: Automatically generates flowcharts based on the data read from CSV, handling various types of nodes and connections.
Customizable Visuals: Users can easily customize node shapes, colors, and styles using a configuration file or directly in the script.
Export Options: Generated flowcharts can be exported as PNG images, making them easy to share and embed in presentations or documents.
